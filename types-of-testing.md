There are 3 types of tests you can create to make robust modules or applications:
* Unit Tests
* Integration Tests
* End to End (e2e) Tests

Some developers prefer to tie these tests to tools such as `grunt` or `gulp`

++**But**++ it is equally important to know how to tie tests and commands together with `npm` and leverage the command-line-interface (CLI). Without this knowledge, developers will find themselves at a severe disadvantage from time to time.
